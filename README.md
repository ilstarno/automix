# AUTOMIX
Create bots for your everyday operations

Automix starts from the need of automating my every day repetitive tasks. First i started this idea as some Python scripts and later on i realised what if i make this idea an project? But hey... not every one has technical skills and not everyone is a programmer and i decided to make it an fully platform for repeating my every day boring tasks.
Since i went to the Windows Ecosystem i had to pass on .net languages and the primary idea was to make Automix an Windows Programm which executes tasks for me, and this way it started as Winforms Based project based on .net .. 
Later on i realised that not everyone is a Windows user unfornatelly, and there are also people who uses Mac, or Linux ecosystem.
So this way i decided to pass to an web idea obviosly based on .net core framework.
Now guess what... 

Automix is a modular robot system which gets job done for you.

Repetitive task such as 
	Reading your mail,
  Extracting reports
  Monitoring folders
  Monitoring FTP 
  Launching an program at specific time.
  Execute scripts for you
  Reading and working with CSV files
  Executing queries in an specific time
  Moving files if older than specific date time
  Sending you remainders 
  Website monitoring
  Converting an website to pdf/html document and so on..
  
  
It already contains 90 modules and every day am working to make new ones of this kind.
Automix is ideal for sys admins, the only think is that it  has to be installed and you're good to go.
Automix server is a standalone language solution that can be integrated to an app that runs NodeJS, Ruby, Python and any other programming environments. via a RESTful API and also every user can create his own modules in C# or Visual Basic soon even Java too :)  .Automix uses .NET Core, a cross-platform version of .NET for building websites, services, and console apps. Thus, Automix provides a cross-platform workflow server and a cross-platform backend for managing, designing and tracking workflows with ease and flexibility.
Automix gives you a beautiful dashboard to view real-time statistics on your robots and operations.Cron jobs are often more useful than trigger or periodic workflows, if you need a job-firing schedule that recurs based on calendar-like notions, rather than on the exactly specified intervals.Everything that happens in Automix is traced and logged. With Automix logging system, you can track your robots with ease and stay informed with real-time monitoring and email notifications.

Until now it supports english and italian languages and i want your help guys to make it as more languages compatible possibile.
